I made this website to function similarly to a business card. A business card really only contains basic information. I am hosting my personal website through Github and prefer this minimalist design because it is straight to the point. Because this website is so simple, it is very easy to edit so feel free to use it for your own website. 

## Notes

* Padding needs improvement. It's not really very modular, so if you want to replace an image you're gonna have to tinker with the margins, but it's not too bad.
* The card on the site is sized to be about the dimensions of a business card and resizes to a non-standard size to work better on mobile.
