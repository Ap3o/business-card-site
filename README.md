I made this website to function similarly to a business card. A business card really only contains basic information.

## Notes
* Padding needs improvement. It's not really very modules, so if you want to replace an image you're gonna have to tinker with the margins, but it's not too bad.
* The card on the site is sized to be about as big as a business card and resized to a non-standard card to work better on mobile.
